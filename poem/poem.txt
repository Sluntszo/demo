Pollution Geographies

I. NO₂ Sonata (USA vs China)
One crimson fissure gnaws at Texas shale—
America's solo nitrogen psalm trembling
through fracking hymns. Across the dateline,
four rusted obelisks mark Beijing's exhalation:
factory choirs gargling sulfuric vibrato,
each smokestack quartering the sky's aorta.

II. Ozone Gradients (Hemispheric Fugue)
Shanghai coughs into the "very unhealthy" violet,
her children's UV shields sold in black markets.
Delhi's smog octave crushes sarangi strings—
a rickshaw driver’s ballad now sung in bronchial.
California's "moderate" blooms like alibi jasmine,
while Phoenix AZ nurses an ozone lesion
wider than the Grand Canyon's absent breath.

III. PM2.5 Monsoon (Indian Subcontinent)
Kolkata's air index hits 497 µg/m³—
gilded particles dance the Kathakali of suffocation.
Mumbai commuters swallow monsoons whole,
each raindrop pregnant with 8.5 microns of history.
The Ganges chokes on devotional microplastics,
its sacred foam now a lung surfactant.

IV. Africa's Particulate Borders
Lagos mothers bake akara in "unhealthy" amber—
PM2.5 crusts shimmer like stolen crude oil.
Johannesburg miners hawk "moderate" as sacrament,
their chest X-rays bartered for clean air futures.
Sahara's harmattan carries EU-dumped nitrate gifts,
a sandstorm's CVS receipt tallies bronchiolar debt.

V. Epilogue: Children's Geography Lesson
"Here, class, is where the atmosphere split:
Four Chinese smokestacks, one Texan wound,
Indian lungs mortgaged to British coal ghosts,
African horizons pawned for Dutch rainmakers.
Color the 'very unhealthy' zones with crayon tears—
this is how we map the arithmetic of breath."
